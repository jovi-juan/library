Manila was a quiet repository of more than 1,500 rare manuscripts, maps and early printed
materials relating to the Philippines and other regions of Asia the Spanish missionaries dreamed
of converting to Christianity. During the British siege of Manila, the treasures of the Convent of
San Pablo were ransacked and its library collection pillaged. The items were sorted and picked
through, some auctioned off on site and others left behind. Towards the end of the British
occupation, the majority of the materials from the San Pablo library ended up in the hands of the
Scottish Hydrographer, Alexander Dalrymple (1737-1808) who very briefly became the
Governor General of the Islands as he replaced the notorious Dawsonne Drake. When Dalrymple
died without an heir, his huge collection of books and manuscripts was auctioned off, among
them what are now called "the Manila Papers." From this mother lode began the slow dispersal
coming out of the United Kingdom through a series of auctions that caused the collection to be
fragmented in three continents. Today only about a hundred items are located in the original site.
The rest of the San Pablo collection can be found interspersed among the Lilly Library at Indiana
University, the Lopez Museum in Manila, the British Library, SOAS University of London, and
King's College.</p>
<p>This digital humanities project seeks to repatriate the books and manuscripts that were taken
from the archives of the Convent of San Pablo. Using the original index of the contents of the
library of San Pablo, the Spanish and British accounts of the use and dispersal of the library's
contents, the records of auctions, library acquisitions and provenance records, the project will
piece together a virtual reconstruction of the materials in the library as close to as it might have
been in 1762.</p>
<p>
Going beyond the digital reconstitution of the archival corpus, the "return" of the library to its
original site is re-imagined to include the reconceptualizing of the library's original systems of
knowledge production, modes of access, and use. This virtual archive will serve as an entry point
to the study of Spanish colonialism in the Pacific and the experience of the communities it
affected, especially in the Philippines. Using digital technologies that explore iterative
scholarship, inter-institutional collaboration and curated crowd-sourcing, the regenerated library
will include spaces for transcribing, translating and annotating the materials.</p><a class="button u-full-width" href="/about">Read more About Us</a></div></article></div></section>
